# Cleaning Data & Interaction

## Explore

We had to make an interactive chart using dirty data. The dirt data had to be cleaned only using code.
When that was done we had to load in the data in a chart and make in interactive using the enter, update and exit functions.


## Review

This assignment for me in particular was pretty damn difficult. I found myself struggling for a long time with this and had to ask multiple students and even friends to help me out with this one.
